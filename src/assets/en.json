Similarly, my adaptability was enhanced, as it was not only about getting used to different technologies, but also about learning quickly to fulfill the tasks, given that I arrived with almost no programming knowledge.",
    "texto2":"The reasons I decided to end my work here were that, in my pursuit of starting to develop myself as a data scientist, despite having obtained a position in the company, the area change was terminated due to internal situations that severely affected the company, leading to the suspension of my area change.

Likewise, my negotiation skills improved by dealing with different types of people and their needs on a daily basis. However, the most crucial aspect was managing emotions, especially under pressure, when making stock purchases or sales.",
    "texto4": "The reason I decided to pause this activity, at least in terms of managing funds for third parties, was that I discovered the field of data science, where, if I managed to develop, I could potentially combine finance with technology in the future. Therefore, I decided to focus on this new area of opportunity, but I still continue to invest personally in the stock market.",
    "p9": "Reading finance and economics books",

Likewise, my organizational skills improved as I had to meet the deadlines for delivering the materials while working from home.",

    "p18": "Company accounting and payroll management",
    "p19": "Personnel management",
    "texto11": "During my first job experience, the greatest strength I gained was responsibility, as it was my first formal job and I had to adhere to schedules and assigned tasks. Similarly, managing personnel helped me develop my communication skills, overcoming my shyness when interacting with strangers. Additionally, handling accounting tasks helped me develop organizational skills and numerical proficiency.",
